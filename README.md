# OpenPantry
## A management system for pantry programs to help people eat healthy meals with dignity

  * NOTES:
    * Requirements are still developing, help with all parts of the project are very much welcome!
    * We haven't finalized registration/authentication/etc requirements, and we want this to be usable by as many organizations as possible
      * As a result, to defer decisions to the last responsible moment, user login is currently faked to just use first user in database via a "FakeUser" plug in routes.  Almost everything is faked/based on mockups leading up to ":locale/food_selections" route, which is the only functional part of the site besides admin at the moment
    * We're using ZenHub chrome extension for project management so if you install that you can see some of the epics and feature discussions there, and contribute to the discussion!
    * If you represent, work with, or know a pantry program that might benefit from using this software, please get in touch or put them in touch so we can try and consider any special requirements or requests they might have sooner than later!
    * We are attempting to make this multi lingual from the start with as much and as many baked in translations as we can
      * We have partial translations started for 9 languages
      * We have thousands of foods from USDA nutritional database ready for dynamic translation
      * We are using POEditor.com for translation, contribute to translations here: https://poeditor.com/join/project/wBfgEEUCht

  * Getting started with development:
    * Docker/docker-compose (fake, factory generated data but no dependencies)
      * Install docker (on most systems this also installs docker-compose)
      * Clone the OpenPantry repo and cd into directory
      * Run `docker-compose run setup`
      * Run `docker-compose up web`


    * Local/native development on Mac/Linux (detailed instructions only for Mac at present, similar for linux)
      * Install Postgres (Mac)
          * Download and install the Postgresapp.com from [their site](https://postgresapp.com/documentation/install.html)
              * Execute the following command in Terminal to configure your $PATH, and then close & reopen the window:
              `sudo mkdir -p /etc/paths.d &&
                echo /Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/latest/bin | sudo tee /etc/paths.d/postgresapp`
          * Alternatively install Postgres with Homebrew
              * Execute (`brew install postgres`) in Terminal
      * if using Postgres.app you must initialize a data directory after installing, and follow instructions for adding CLI tools to your Terminal path...  `which psql` but succeed when done
        * (instructions defaulting to Mac below... for simplicity, linux users extrapolate, Windows, I have no idea, PR's with instructions for either/both welcome)
      * Install Elixir/Erlang (`brew install elixir`)
      * Install postgis (`brew install postgis`)
      * Install NPM and yarn (`brew install node && npm install -g yarn`)
      * Clone this repository locally, `git clone git@github.com:MasbiaSoupKitchenNetwork/open_pantry.git`
      * cd into the directory `cd open_pantry`
      * Download database from s3 via `wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/open-pantry/openpantry.dump`
        * Note we had problems with this dump being improperly generated recently.  I beleive the problem is fixed, but if you downloaded previously or have problems please contact someone for support, it's probably not your fault!
        * Dumps and restores are based on the method described here: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgres-import-export
      * Install Elixir package dependencies with `mix deps.get`
      * Create the database in Postgres with `mix ecto.create`, assuming default password etc in config works.
      * Migrate the database to add migrations since dump was created, via `mix ecto.migrate`
      * Import the dump to the database via `pg_restore --verbose --clean --no-acl --no-owner -h localhost -U postgres -d open_pantry_dev openpantry.dump`
      * Install Node.js dependencies with `yarn install`
      * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`, or `iex -S mix phx.server` (this gives a server and REPL/console in one window)
    * ALTERNATIVELY (and with much less detail), if you DON'T WANT TO USE the dump file referenced above/want to generate a dump from scratch, the above dump was generated with a complete USDA food/nutrient database approximately as below, along with non-dump steps above:
      * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
      * Git clone https://github.com/MasbiaSoupKitchenNetwork/nutes locally and run make, modifying if necessary to point at your Postgres DB and the directory path to your local copy in imports.sql (requires golang to build data_cleanup tool)
      * Add seed data with `mix run priv/repo/seeds.exs` but modify to leave out foods/stocks as these are fakes generated by factories, you have real food from USDA

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
